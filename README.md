# Operating System Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a custom operating system developed from scratch. The OS is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating core OS concepts such as process management, memory allocation, and file systems. It targets x86 architecture and is built using C and Assembly.

## Features
- Basic kernel with interrupt handling
- Process scheduling (Round-Robin)
- Virtual memory management
- Simple file system (FAT32-like)
- Command-line interface (shell)
- Bootloader compatible with GRUB

## Prerequisites
- GCC or Clang compiler
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- QEMU or Bochs for emulation
- GNU Make
- A Unix-like environment (Linux/MacOS) or WSL on Windows

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/operating-system.git
   cd operating-system
